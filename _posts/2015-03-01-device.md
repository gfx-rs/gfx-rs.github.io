title: Device Abstraction
---

Up until now, gfx-rs wasn't ready to support multiple APIs. We had a tight coupling of the `device` with OpenGL code by using direct typedefs to `GLuint` types behind GL resources. We couldn't figure out how to best abstract it before associated types were introduced to Rust. It is a really powerful tool in hands of Rust programmers, and we weren't shy of exploring the limits of it.

An abstract device has different types associated with it: buffer, texture, sampler, and others. They are used in 2 large groups of methods:

  1. Inside `CommandBuffer` trait, which uses these types for rendering.
  2. In the resource management routines (`create_buffer()` and such), which belong to the device.

Since both `CommandBuffer` and the `Device` needed access to all the resource types, we decided to enclose them into a separate `Resources` trait, which became an associated type for our command buffers and devices:
```rust
pub trait Resources: {
    type Buffer;
    type ArrayBuffer;
    type Shader;
    type Program;
    type FrameBuffer;
    type Surface;
    type Texture;
    type Sampler;
}
```

Here is a part of the `Device` trait:
```rust
pub trait Device {
    type Resources: Resources;
    type Mapper: Clone + RawMapping;
    type CommandBuffer: draw::CommandBuffer<Resources = Self::Resources>;
    ...
    fn submit(&mut self, buffer: (&Self::CommandBuffer, &draw::DataBuffer));
    fn create_buffer<T>(&mut self, num: usize, usage: BufferUsage) -> BufferHandle<Self::Resources, T>
    fn create_sampler(&mut self, info: tex::SamplerInfo) -> SamplerHandle<Self::Resources>;
    ...
}
```

The GL backend implements `Resources` with a phantom enum:
```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
pub enum GlResources {}

impl Resources for GlResources {
    type Buffer = Buffer;
    type ArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer;
    type Shader = Shader;
    type Program = Program;
    type FrameBuffer = FrameBuffer;
    type Surface = Surface;
    type Texture = Texture;
    type Sampler = Sampler;
}
```


The migration was started by @bjz in a long series of pull requests ([#564](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/564), [#589](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/589), [#590](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/590), [#592](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/592), [#593](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/593), [#597](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/597)) and finished by @kvark ([`gfx-rs`/#598](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/pull/598), [`gfx-rs`/#609](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/pull/609), [`gfx_device_gl`/#1](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx_device_gl/pull/1)). The result - [`gfx_device_gl`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx_device_gl) is a separate crate now that `gfx` itself doesn't depend on. Examples are moved into [their own home](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx_examples) as well. Even the macro-generated implementations for shader parameters and vertex formats are API-independent now.

Needless to say, all of the device abstraction mess is just a burden on our users (sorry!) until we really have [more devices](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/352). The good news is we are actually ready now to add these, and API fluctuations will be smaller. All the libraries on top of gfx-rs ([`gfx_texture`](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/gfx_texture), [`gfx_graphics`](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/gfx_graphics), [`gfx_debug_draw`](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/gfx-debug-draw), etc) as well as large parts of the client code (see [hematite](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite)) don't rely on OpenGL.

Current state of our architecture is not solid - we are still in flux, but the important milestone is nevertheless reached. We are now looking to simplify things, both internally and user-exposed:

- group up [resource management](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/570) methods
- simplify [handle types](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/616)
- make examples library device independent, and hook up device-specific examples (`gfx_device_gl/examples`) to it, while having only minimal code for window/device initialization and event handling

Thanks everyone for supporting us, bearing with our breaking changes, providing fair feedback, and building incredible things with our cross-API technology ([snowmew](https://github.com/csherratt/snowmew), [hematite](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite))!

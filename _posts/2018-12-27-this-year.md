title: This Year in Gfx-rs - 2018
---

In 2018 the project went out the nursery and entered the adolescence period:
  - we [established](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2018/04/09/vulkan-portability.html) the gfx-portability project
  - we optimized the Metal backend and [challenged](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2018/08/10/dota2-macos-performance.html) MoltenVK for Dota2 performance
  - [@fkaa](https://github.com/fkaa) successfully [implemented](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2018/08/14/gsoc.html) DX11 backend during GSoC
  - we [collaborated](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2018/09/03/rpcs3-dolphin.html) with Dolphin and RPCS3 to extend their support on Macs
  - we [debated](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/2206) the philosophy of ~~life~~ abstraction level
  - [Szeged team](https://github.com/szeged) ported WebRender over and got Firefox and Servo [running](https://github.com/kvark/slides/blob/master/FirefoxOnGFX_OrlandoAllHands.pdf) on gfx-hal

Our API has settled to be at the lowest level, practically matching Vulkan semantics now. To compensate for this, we have started WebGPU [implementation](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) with the idea of it becoming the lowest *safe* graphics abstraction that is a pleasure to use directly when targeting either native platforms or the future Web. Crossing fingers to tell you more about its progress in 2019 ;)

And for the logical conclusion, with help from relentless [@omni-viral](https://github.com/omni-viral), we have finally [published](https://crates.io/crates/gfx-hal/0.1.0) the new crates! This isn't the end, it's the beginning of adult life for the project. We are looking forward to see Amethyst, ggez, and potentially other community efforts taking advantage of our graphics abstraction.
